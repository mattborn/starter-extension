# Chrome Extension Starter

## Why this?

It had been awhile since I worked on an extension and I thought AI could help me get back up to speed quickly. Then ChatGPT wasted hours and hours of my life. Hopefully this will save us both time.

## Hot reloading

The internet doesnâ€™t seem like it has a found a good solution for hot reloading during development since [manifest v3 was enforced](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/migrate/what-is-mv3). Once again a massively influential juggernaut of human experience puts obscure security standards ahead of development ergonomics. To suppress the scrappy hacker is to smother casual innovation. Thanks, Google.

For now, we must manually reload the extension after every change.
